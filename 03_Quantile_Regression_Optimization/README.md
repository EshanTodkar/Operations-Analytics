# Quantile Regression & Optimization

## Overview
This folder contains advanced regression techniques and optimization methods for risk-aware decision making.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Quantile Regression Analysis**
- **Multiple Quantile Modeling**
- **Risk Management & Decision Making**
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**
- **Inventory Optimization**

## Files
- `HW3_Q1.R` - Quantile regression implementation
- `quantile_train.csv` - Training dataset
- `quantile_test.csv` - Test dataset for validation

## Key Achievements
- Implemented quantile regression for 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles
- Calculated optimal ordering quantities based on quality scores
- Performed out-of-sample cost analysis for different quantiles
- Demonstrated risk-aware decision making through quantile analysis

## Business Applications
- Inventory optimization
- Supply chain risk management
- Quality-demand relationship analysis
- Cost minimization strategies
- Overstock vs. understock cost optimization

## Technical Stack
- **R Programming**: `quantreg`, `ggplot2`
- **Statistical Methods**: Quantile regression, cost optimization
- **Data Sources**: CSV files with quality and demand data
